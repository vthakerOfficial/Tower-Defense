# Tower Defense (IN DEVELOPMENT)

## Overview
Welcome to **Tower Defense**! You're on an island surrounded by an endless ocean, but then you see a dark, looming castle out in the distance. 
Boats with monsters head towards your island. Protect your island at all costs by placing towers that displace and damage enemies!

Strategically place towers to make it harder for enemies to reach your island.

If enemies do reach your island, you can make your final stand with a machine gun. But beware, you only have 30 seconds, afterwhich you return to the sky.

## How to Play 
1. **Spawn:** You start in the sky with 5 gold. You use this gold to buy towers to place on a grid. 
2. **Fight Monsters:** Two ways to kill monsters. 1) Place Towers 2) Machine Gun 3) Send Spells (meteors, poison, freeze, etc)
3. **Protect your island:** Make sure your island health doesn't get too low or its GAME OVER.
